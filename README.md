This is my 6th project as an intern at elevate labs where i have to host a static website using github pages.
These are the steps that i took to complete this project:
- Initialised an ec2 instance along with the creation of the github repository to  carry out the project
- wrote index.html and style.css (just basic) to give additonal touch to the website.
- pushed everyting to the github repository from the ec2 instance.
- hosted the website from github pages.
- link to the website:(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a994e757-81dc-44dc-af89-36432d43e08f)
